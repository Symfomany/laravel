## Structure

+ The app directory, as you might expect, contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this folder in more detail soon.

+ The bootstrap folder contains a few files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading, as well as a cache folder that contains a few framework generated files for bootstrap performance optimization.

+ The config directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application's configuration files.

+ The database folder contains your database migration and seeds. If you wish, you may also use this folder to hold an SQLite database.

+ The public directory contains the front controller and your assets (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).

+ The resources directory contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and localization files.

+ The storage directory contains compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This folder is segregated into app, framework, and logs directories. The app directory may be used to store any files utilized by your application. The framework directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. Finally, the logs directory contains your application's log files.

+ The tests directory contains your automated tests. An example PHPUnit is provided out of the box.

+ The vendor directory contains your Composer dependencies.




## Namespace

As discussed above, the default application namespace is App; however, you may change this namespace to match the name of your application, which is easily done via the app:name Artisan command. 
For example, if your application is named "Ci", nemayou would run the following command:
+ php artisan app:name SocialNet


## App directory

+ The app directory ships with a variety of additional directories such as Console, Http, and Providers.:
+ Think of the Console and Http directories as providing an API into the "core" of your application. 
+ The HTTP protocol and CLI are both mechanisms to interact with your application, but do not actually contain application logic. In other words, they are simply two ways of issuing commands to your application. 
+ The Console directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the Http directory contains your controllers, filters, and requests.
+ The Jobs directory, of course, houses the queueable jobs for your application. Jobs may be queued by your application, as well as be run synchronously within the current request lifecycle.
+ The Events directory, as you might expect, houses event classes. Events may be used to alert other parts of your application that a given action has occurred, providing a great deal of flexibility and decoupling.
+ The Listeners directory contains the handler classes for your events. Handlers receive an event and perform logic in response to the event being fired. For example, a UserRegistered event might be handled by a SendWelcomeEmail listener.

+ The Exceptions directory contains your application's exception handler and is also a good place to stick any exceptions thrown by your application.


## Installation

Via Laravel Installer
+ composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"
Make sure to place the ~/.composer/vendor/bin directory in your PATH so the laravel executable can be located by your system.
And next:
laravel new blog


Or via Composer:
+ composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist
  

Directory Permissions
Directories within the /storage and the /bootstrap/cache directories should be writable by your web server.
If you are using the Homestead virtual machine, these permissions should already be set.


The next thing you should do after installing Laravel is set your application key to a random string.
If you installed Laravel via Composer or the Laravel installer, this key has already been set for you by the key:generate command.
Typically, this string should be 32 characters long
+ php artisan key:generate
If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!



## Environment Configuration
https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv =>  DotEnv PHP library
All of the variables listed in this file will be loaded into the $_ENV PHP super-global when your application receives a request.

+ Accessing:
$environment = App::environment();

+ You may also pass arguments to the environment method to check if the environment matches a given value. You may even pass multiple values if necessary:
  

if (App::environment('local')) {
    // The environment is local
}

if (App::environment('local', 'staging')) {
    // The environment is either local OR staging...
}


## General Config 
+ Debug à true
+ Url a modifier
+ Timezone
+ Language && Fallback
+ Providers; Services third
+ Aliases

## Debogage

+ Require this package with composer:
composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar

Then,
Barryvdh\Debugbar\ServiceProvider::class,
'Debugbar' => Barryvdh\Debugbar\Facade::class,

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
